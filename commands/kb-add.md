Review the current conversation and identify valuable information worth preserving for future tasks. Focus on:

- **Code locations**: Where specific features, modules, or functionality reside
- **Commands and procedures**: How to run tests, build, deploy, or troubleshoot
- **Architecture decisions**: Why certain approaches were chosen, tech stack details
- **Troubleshooting solutions**: Fixes for specific errors or issues encountered
- **Configuration details**: Environment setup, credentials locations, API endpoints
- **Workflow patterns**: Successful approaches to common tasks

For each piece of information identified:

1. Determine if it's **repository-specific** or **general knowledge**
2. Use the knowledge-base skill to add it to the appropriate location
3. Ensure content is **merged intelligently** with existing documentation (no duplication)
4. Include specific file paths, commands, and concrete examples

**Repository-specific** → `~/git/knowledge-base/repos/<repo-name>/`
**General knowledge** → `~/git/knowledge-base/`

Skip information that is:
- Already well-documented in official docs
- Temporary or one-off issues
- Too trivial to need future reference
